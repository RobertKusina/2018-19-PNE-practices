Here you will take your notes :D

We will create a program C (C stands for client) and in another place on the internet there is a program S called server, we want to comunicatge those programs.
Client-server model.
Network interface, IP adress, important concepts.
My mobile phone IP adress at the university is 10.0.43.80, the IP adress from the teacher's phone is 10.3.52.118.
The IP adress of this machine is inet 212.128.253.65
Teacher's IP (for today 12/2/2019) is: 212.128.253.64
The ping is to check if it's alive.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=121 time=3.54 ms
*(It took 3.54 ms to ping it to 8.8.8.8)

64 bytes from 212.128.253.64: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.382 ms
*(It took 0,382 ms to ping it to our own IP)
ip from Mar√≠a, 212.128.253.66
64 bytes from 212.128.253.66: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.395 ms
*(It took 0,395 ms to ping it to Maria's pc)

64 bytes from 10.0.43.80: icmp_seq=1 ttl=62 time=196 ms
*(IT took 196 ms to ping it to my phone)
We as humans use URLS instead of IPs, URLS are for identifying a computer interface for humans www.google.com is an url.

PING www.google.com (216.58.211.228) 56(84) bytes of data. It also took 3,49 ms to connect.
It also gave us it's IP adress, 216.58.211.228
The ping to our university is 212.128.240.50
Port, important concept. We both need, the IP and the port where the server is located.THIS IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILETHIS IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILETHIS IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILETHIS IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILETHIS IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILE
